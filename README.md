## Introduction  

The fan controller board provides robust control over fan operation, supporting open loop and closed loop control schemes. It integrates intuitive interfaces for input and output, making it a versatile tool for a range of applications.  

---

## Features  

- **Modes of Operation**:  
  - Open Loop Control  
  - Closed Loop Control with User-Variable Fan Speed  
  - Closed Loop Control with Temperature Measurements  

- **User Interfaces**:  
  - **Inputs**:
    - Rotary encoder (Extension board)
    - Button  
  - **Visual Outputs**:  
    - 2-digit 7-segment display (HDSP-521E)  
    - LCD screen (ST7066U)  
    - LEDs (Board and Extension board)  
    - Temperature sensor (TC74)  

- **Real-Time Feedback** for fan control and monitoring.  

---

## Modes of Operation  

1. **Open Loop Control**:  
   - The fan runs at a user-set duty cycle.  
   - Duty cycle is adjustable using the rotary encoder.  

2. **Closed Loop Control with Variable Fan Speed**:  
   - The fan speed is controlled to match a user-defined target RPM.  
   - Rotary encoder is used to set the target RPM.  

3. **Closed Loop Control with Temperature Measurements**:  
   - The fan speed adjusts automatically based on the measured temperature.  
   - No rotary encoder input is needed in this mode.  

---

## Interfaces  

### User Inputs  
- **Rotary Encoder**:  
  - Adjusts duty cycle in Open Loop Mode.  
  - Sets target RPM in Closed Loop Fan Speed Mode.  
  - Unused in Closed Loop Temperature Mode.  

- **Button**:  
  - Toggles between the three modes.  

### Visual Outputs  
- **2-Digit 7-Segment Display**:  
  - Displays:  
    - Current duty cycle (%) in Open Loop Mode.  
    - Percentage error between target RPM and current RPM in Closed Loop Fan Speed Mode.  
    - Current temperature from the TC74 sensor in Closed Loop Temperature Mode.  

- **LCD Screen**:  
  - Displays:  
    - **First Line**:  
      - Time delta for speed readings in Open Loop Mode.  
      - Target RPM in Closed Loop Fan Speed Mode.  
      - Target temperature in Closed Loop Temperature Mode.
    - **Second Line**: Current fan speed in all modes.  

- **LEDs**: Indicate various states and operational statuses.
- **Multi-Colour LED**: Indicates the stability of the fan speed.

## FAQ

### Q: The system doesn't start in Open Loop Mode.
A: Check the wiring connections and ensure the power supply is correct. The system should automatically start in Open Loop Mode upon power-up.

### Q: How do I adjust the fan speed in Closed Loop Fan Speed Mode?
A: Use the rotary encoder to set the target RPM in Closed Loop Fan Speed Mode.

### Q: I cannot see anything on the LCD Screen.
A: Change the resistance on the 460Ohm potentiometer and check the connections.

### Q: The fan is plugged in but is not spinning.
A: Ensure that the power supply is turned on and that there is a valid connection into the banana sockets on the extension board.

### Q: The temperature sensor is not displaying the right temperature.
A: The connections are incorrect, the SDA and SCLK do not have the correct pull up resistor, it is a faulty device, or there is interference with other signals from long leads.

### Q: How can I prevent signal interference?
A: Ensure that the power supplies for the device and fan are separate, this is commonly found when using a USB DC-DC converter on a PC with the power cable for the development board coming from the PC as well.
